# Quick Start: Implementing Development Skills in Your Team

## For Team Leads - 15 Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install the First Skill (5 minutes)

1. Download `nextjs-module-builder.skill` file
2. Share with all developers
3. Each developer installs it in Claude:
   - Open Claude
   - Go to Skills tab
   - Click "Import Skill"
   - Upload the .skill file

### Step 2: Quick Team Training (10 minutes)

**In your next standup, demonstrate:**

1. **How to trigger the skill:**
   ```
   Developer: "I need to create a new student enrollment module"
   Claude: [Reads nextjs-module-builder skill automatically]
   ```

2. **What Claude will do:**
   - Guide through all 5 layers
   - Provide exact code examples
   - Follow your naming conventions
   - Apply your permissions system
   - Include proper error handling

3. **Key benefits:**
   - No more "how should I structure this?"
   - Consistent code across team
   - 30-40% faster development
   - Fewer code review iterations

### Step 3: First Team Task (Today)

**Assign these tasks to developers:**

1. **Junior Dev:** Create a simple CRUD module for "Tags" using the skill
2. **Mid Dev:** Add database patterns to the skill based on recent issues
3. **Senior Dev:** Start creating "Supabase Database Manager" skill

## For Developers - Using Skills Effectively

### When to Use the Module Builder Skill

**Always use when:**
- Creating any new CRUD feature
- Adding new entity to existing module
- Uncertain about architecture
- Need consistent code structure

**How to use:**
```
You: "Create a courses management module with CRUD operations"

Claude: [Automatically loads nextjs-module-builder skill]
[Walks through 5 layers with code examples]
[Uses your naming conventions]
[Applies your permission patterns]
```

### Skill Workflow Example

```
You: "I need to add a billing discounts module"

Claude reads skill â†’ Asks about requirements â†’ Guides through:

1. Database Schema (with RLS)
   âœ“ Creates table definition
   âœ“ Adds proper indexes
   âœ“ Includes RLS policies
   
2. TypeScript Types
   âœ“ Entity interface
   âœ“ DTOs (Create/Update)
   âœ“ Filters interface
   
3. Service Layer
   âœ“ CRUD methods
   âœ“ Error handling
   âœ“ Logging format
   
4. React Hooks
   âœ“ State management
   âœ“ Data fetching
   âœ“ Institution filtering
   
5. UI Components
   âœ“ Data table
   âœ“ Forms
   âœ“ Filters
   
6. Pages & Routing
   âœ“ List view
   âœ“ Create/Edit pages
   âœ“ Permissions

Result: Complete, consistent, production-ready module
Time: 4-5 hours (vs 7-8 hours without skill)
```

### Common Questions

**Q: Will Claude always use the skill?**
A: Yes, when you mention creating modules, features, or CRUD operations, Claude will automatically read the skill.

**Q: Can I modify the skill?**
A: Yes! Update the reference files with your team's improvements, then re-package and share.

**Q: What if the skill doesn't cover my use case?**
A: Use the patterns from the skill as a starting point, then add your specific requirements to the skill for next time.

**Q: How do I know what skills are available?**
A: Check the DEVELOPMENT_SKILLS_ROADMAP.md document for all planned skills and their status.

## Team Collaboration with Skills

### Sharing Improvements

**When you discover a better pattern:**

1. Document it clearly
2. Add to relevant skill reference file
3. Test thoroughly
4. Share in team channel
5. Update skill version

**Example:**
```
Developer finds better RLS pattern
â†’ Updates database-patterns.md reference
â†’ Re-packages skill
â†’ Shares: "Updated DB skill with optimized RLS pattern"
â†’ Team benefits immediately
```

### Code Review with Skills

**Reviewer checklist:**
- [ ] Follows skill patterns?
- [ ] Uses correct naming conventions?
- [ ] Has proper error handling?
- [ ] Includes logging with module prefix?
- [ ] Applies permissions correctly?

**If not following skill:**
```
Reviewer: "Please follow the module builder skill patterns for 
the service layer - needs error handling and proper logging format"

Developer: [Uses skill to fix] âœ“
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude isn't using my skill"

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure skill description is specific enough
2. Use trigger words: "module", "CRUD", "feature"
3. Explicitly mention: "Use the module builder skill"

### "Skill pattern doesn't fit my use case"

**Solutions:**
1. Use skill as foundation, adapt as needed
2. Document your adaptation
3. Propose skill update for similar future cases

### "Need help creating new skills"

**Resources:**
1. Read /mnt/skills/public/skill-creator/SKILL.md
2. Use existing skills as templates
3. Start with references, then write SKILL.md
4. Test thoroughly before sharing
